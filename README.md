# Deep-Neural-Networks-Model-Keras-Tensorflow-
Understood the basics of the deep neural networks. Build the DNN models FCNN, CNN and RESENT50 in keras & tensorflow. Tested the models built on the following datasets:

1. From keras.datasets imported MNIST dataset which contains images of handwritten digits and has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. A three dense layered Fully Connected Neural Network model was build and the model was tested by this dataset from scratch.

2. From keras.datasets imported CIFAR-10 dataset which contains colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test         images. A Convolutional Neural Networks model comrising of three convolutional layers and two dense layers was built and the CIFAR-10 dataset was tested on this model from scratch.

3. Locally imported the Hand-sign Dataset in .h5 format using the h5py package. There are a total 1080 images in the train data and 120 images in the test data, each of which is a 3 channel image of dimension 64x64. A deep learning neural network, ResNet-50 was made to recognize numeric signs using our hand and the model was tested on the above mentioned dataset from scratch.


# Bubble-Sort-Algorithm-in-Python
Bubblesort is an elementary sorting algorithm. The idea is to
imagine bubbling the smallest elements of a (vertical) array to the
top; then bubble the next smallest; then so on until the entire
array is sorted. Bubble sort is worse than both insertion sort and
selection sort. It moves elements as many times as insertion sort
(bad) and it takes as long as selection sort (bad). On the positive
side, bubble sort is easy to understand. Also there are highly
improved variants of bubble sort.
